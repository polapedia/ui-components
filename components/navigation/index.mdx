# Navigation

The **Navigation** component is used as the global header of Polapedia.  
It includes the logo, the main navigation links, and a primary **Contact** action button.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to adjust `items`, `activeHref`, `variant`, `sticky`, and other properties interactively.

---

## Variants

### Elevated (Default)

A white background with soft shadow. Recommended for gray or colored backgrounds.

<Canvas of={NavigationStories.Playground} />

### Flat

No shadow—only a subtle border. Suitable for minimalist page layouts.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={NavigationStories.Playground} args={{ variant: "flat" }} />
</Canvas>

---

## Responsive Behavior

The Navigation component is fully **responsive**:

### Desktop / Tablet

- Links are displayed horizontally.
- The **Contact** button appears on the right.

---

## UI States

Navigation supports the following UI states:

- **Default** - standard appearance.
- **Hover** - link text color intensifies on hover.
- **Active / Pressed** - clickable feedback.
- **Active Route** - link matching `activeHref` appears highlighted.
- **Disabled** - link appears dimmed and cannot be interacted with.
- **Focus** - visible focus outline for keyboard users.

<Canvas of={NavigationStories.StatesShowcase} />

> Use the mouse to test hover and pressed states.  
> Press `Tab` to explore focus states.

---

## Interaction & Behavior

- Clicking a navigation link routes to its corresponding `href`.
- `activeHref` is used to visually indicate the current active page.
- The active link includes `aria-current="page"` for accessibility.
- **`onContactClick` is fired when the Contact button is pressed.**  
  In Storybook this event appears in the **Actions** panel.
- On mobile, the hamburger button toggles the drawer and updates `aria-expanded`.

---

## Example: Handling `onContactClick`

Below is an example illustrating how to navigate to `/contact` using `router.push()` inside a Next.js environment.

### Rendered Example

export const NavWithContactRouting = () => {
  const router = require("next/navigation").useRouter();

return (

<Navigation
  {...NavigationStories.Playground.args}
  onContactClick={() => router.push("/contact")}
/>
); };

<Canvas>
  <NavWithContactRouting />
</Canvas>

### Source Code

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import Navigation, { NavItem } from "@/components/navigation";

const items: NavItem[] = [
{ label: "Home", href: "/" },
{ label: "About Us", href: "/about" },
{ label: "Polo AI", href: "/polo-ai" },
{ label: "Marketplace", href: "/marketplace" },
{ label: "Terms Of Service", href: "/tos" },
];

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter();

return (

<Navigation
  items={items}
  activeHref="/"
  contactLabel="Contact"
  onContactClick={() => router.push("/contact")}
/>
); }`}

> </Source>

## Props

<ArgTypes of={NavigationStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this component as the **global header** across main Polapedia pages.
- Ensure that only one link is marked as active using `activeHref`.
- Use `disabled: true` for links pointing to unreleased pages.
- Hide the Contact button using `hideContactButton` on pages where CTA is unnecessary (e.g., Contact page itself).
- Pick a variant based on context:
  - **Elevated** for backgrounds with color or texture.
  - **Flat** for clean, content-heavy white backgrounds.

---

## Accessibility

- Uses semantic `<nav>` and `<a>` elements.
- Active link includes `aria-current="page"`.
- Hamburger uses `<button>` with proper `aria-label` and `aria-expanded`.
- Focus styles are visible for keyboard navigation.
- Text labels are required to ensure compatibility with screen readers.
