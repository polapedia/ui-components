# Button Dropdown

Button Dropdown displays a list of additional related options or actions when triggered.
It combines a standard button style with a toggleable overlay, useful for grouping secondary actions or displaying contextual information.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `variant`, `size`, and `disabled`.

---

## Variants

### Primary

The default style, using the brand gradient. Used for main actions that require sub-options.

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.Primary} />

### Inverted

A dark theme variant, suitable for light backgrounds where a strong contrast is needed or for specific UI themes.

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.Inverted} />

### Error

Indicates a destructive action or an error state that requires user attention.

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.Error} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.Disabled} />

---

## Sizes

Button Dropdown comes in three sizes with specific height requirements to ensure touch targets are accessible:

- **sm** - height 40px
- **md** - height 56px
- **lg** - height 70px

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.Sizes} />

## Content Customization

The dropdown content (`children`) is flexible. While it defaults to a tooltip-like text, you can pass custom JSX such as a list of links or a small form.

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.CustomContent} />

---

## UI States

The component supports standard states:

- **Default** - Initial appearance.
- **Active / Open** - When clicked, the chevron rotates and the dropdown appears.
- **Disabled** - Opacity is reduced, and interaction is blocked.

<Canvas of={ButtonDropdownStories.States} />

## Interaction & Behavior

- **Trigger:** The dropdown is triggered by a **click** event on the entire button area.
- **Dismissal:** Clicking outside the component (`useOnClickOutside`) triggers the dropdown to close.
- **Positioning:** The dropdown appears absolutely positioned below the button.

## Props

## Usage Guidelines

- **Grouping:** Use Button Dropdown to declutter the UI by hiding secondary actions behind a single trigger.
- **Labeling:** Ensure the `label` clearly indicates the category of actions inside (e.g., "Export", "Settings").
