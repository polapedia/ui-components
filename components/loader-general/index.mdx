# Loader

The Loader component provides a visual cue that an action is being processed or data is being retrieved.
It uses a spinning icon to indicate activity and supports multiple sizes to fit different contexts.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LoaderStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to test different sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`).

---

## Sizes

The loader is available in three fixed sizes to match the hierarchy of the surrounding content.

- **sm** - Used for inline loading, such as inside small buttons or tight data tables (`size-6`).
- **md** - The default size, suitable for standard buttons or card content (`size-8`).
- **lg** - Larger size for prominence, useful for section-level loading (`size-10`).

## Props

<ArgTypes of={LoaderStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

- **Context:** Use this loader for inline feedback (e.g., inside a button, next to a label). For full-page or container-filling loading states, consider using the `LoaderCustom` (Lottie) component instead.
- **Positioning:** Ensure the loader is vertically centered relative to adjacent text or elements.
- **Visual Feedback:** The loader currently uses the `text-accents-red` color to indicate activity. Ensure it is placed on a background that provides sufficient contrast.

---

## Accessibility

- **ARIA Roles:** The component automatically includes `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
- **Screen Readers:** This configuration ensures that screen readers notify users when a loading state appears or updates without interrupting their current task.
