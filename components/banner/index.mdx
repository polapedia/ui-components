# Banner

The **Banner** component provides contextual feedback messages that appear at the top of sections or layouts.
Banners are commonly used to communicate information, success confirmation, warnings, or error states.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to interactively modify props such as `variant`, `title`, `description`, and icons.

---

## Variants

Banners support four semantic variants, each with a corresponding background and circular icon container:

- **Info** — informative or neutral messages
- **Success** — confirmation or successful operation
- **Warning** — caution or attention needed
- **Danger** — errors or critical issues

<Canvas of={BannerStories.Variants} />

---

## With Icon

Banners can include a left icon wrapped inside a 16px colored circular background.  
This visually reinforces the message context.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={BannerStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- Use banners to deliver important contextual information to the user.
- Use **success** for positive confirmations, **warning** for cautionary notes, and **danger** for critical alerts.
- Use **info** for general messages that do not require strong emphasis.

### Content Recommendations

- Keep `title` concise and direct.
- Use `description` for additional supporting details.
- Avoid overusing banners to prevent visual clutter.

### Layout & Behavior

- Icons align visually with the title for balanced hierarchy.
- The left icon area is optional—when omitted, the text shifts naturally.

---

## Accessibility

- Ensure understandable and concise messaging in `title` and `description`.
- Provide adequate color contrast between background and text.
- When banners are interactive (e.g., dismissible or clickable), wrap them in semantic elements such as `<button>` or `<a>` and provide appropriate ARIA attributes.
