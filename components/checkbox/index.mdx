# Checkbox

The **Checkbox** component lets users make binary choices  
and is primarily intended for **multiple selection**, while still supporting single-select usage.  
It supports two sizes, validation states, helper messages, disabled and required states.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as  
`size`, `state`, `disabled`, `required`, `label`, `helperText`, and `checked`.

---

## Variants & Features

### Checked State

A checkbox can be controlled via the `checked` prop.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Checked} />

---

### Disabled

Disabled checkboxes appear muted and non-interactive.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Disabled} />

---

### With Helper Text

Use `helperText` to provide additional guidance or validation messages.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.WithHelperText} />

---

## Sizes

Checkbox supports two control sizes that scale both the box and the label:

- **sm** - compact checkbox with smaller label text
- **md** - default checkbox and label size

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Sizes} />

---

## Validation States

Checkbox supports semantic feedback for form validation:

- **default** - standard appearance
- **error** - red border and label for invalid states

Use the `state` prop to switch between visual styles.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Error} />

and a small checkbox group for multi-select behavior.

## Interaction & Behavior

- The Checkbox toggles its value using the standard `onChange` event.
- Storybook logs value changes in the **Actions** panel.
- The component can be used as:
  - **Controlled** - pass a `checked` prop and handle `onChange`.
  - **Uncontrolled** - omit `checked`; the browser manages its own state.
- `required` can be used alongside native form validation.
- Combine multiple `Checkbox` components to build checkbox groups or preference lists.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **Checkbox** for binary decisions where users can select **zero, one, or many** options:
  - e.g., notification preferences, feature toggles, filter selections.
- Use the `label` prop to clearly describe what the checkbox controls.
- Use `helperText` for additional context or inline validation messages.
- Use `state="error"` when validation fails (e.g., “You must accept the terms”).
- Prefer concise labels and helper text; avoid relying only on surrounding copy.

---

## Accessibility

- Uses a semantic `<input type="checkbox" />` for proper screen reader support.
- Each Checkbox should have an associated `label` for clarity and a larger click target.
- Focus outlines and focus rings are preserved for keyboard navigation.
- When using `state="error"`, ensure `helperText` clearly explains what is wrong.
