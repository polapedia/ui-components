# Button

Buttons trigger actions such as submitting a form or showing or hiding an interface component.  
They come in three emphasis levels — Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary — and support multiple sizes and shapes for different interaction patterns.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `variant`, `size`, `shape`, icons, and behavioral states like `loading` or `disabled`.

---

## Variants

### Primary

Used for the most prominent action on a screen.

### Secondary

Ideal for alternative or less prominent actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Tertiary

Low-emphasis option suitable for subtle or inline actions.

## Sizes

- **sm** – compact button for dense or constrained UIs.
- **md** – default size for standard actions.
- **lg** – large, attention-drawing actions such as primary CTA.

## Shapes

- **rectangle** – default, versatile shape for most use cases.
- **pill** – friendlier, softer shape suitable for marketing or CTA emphasis.
- **circle** – dedicated for icon-only actions.

## UI States

The Button component supports the following UI states:

- **Default** – initial visual appearance.
- **Hover** – pointer hovering state.
- **Active / Pressed** – when the button is pressed.
- **Disabled** – inactive, non-interactive state.
- **Loading** – shows a spinner and blocks interaction.
- **Focus** – visible outline when accessed via keyboard.

## Interaction & Behavior

- The Button triggers the `onClick` handler when activated.
- Storybook logs click events in the **Actions** panel via `onClick: "clicked"`.
- For forms, pass `type="submit"` when the Button should submit data.
- Setting `isLoading` automatically disables the Button and shows a spinner.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **only one** primary button per screen to maintain a clear visual hierarchy.
- Use secondary buttons for less important or alternative actions.
- Use tertiary buttons for inline or low-emphasis actions.
- Avoid using circle buttons without icons.
- Prefer `isLoading` over combining `disabled` and `isLoading` manually; loading should block interaction and show clear feedback.

---

## Accessibility

- The Button uses a semantic `<button>` element for accessibility.
- Keep focus styles visible for keyboard users.
- Ensure button labels are descriptive so screen readers can convey their purpose.
