# Button

Buttons trigger actions such as submitting a form or showing or hiding an interface component.  
They come in four emphasis levels — **Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Outline Primary** — and support multiple sizes and shapes for different interaction patterns.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `variant`, `size`, `shape`, icons, and behavioral states like `isLoading` or `disabled`.

---

## Variants

### Primary

Used for the most prominent action on a screen.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

---

### Secondary

Ideal for alternative or less prominent actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

---

### Tertiary

Low-emphasis option suitable for subtle or inline actions.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Tertiary} />

---

### Outline Primary

A bordered, low-visual-weight variant that still conveys a primary action.  
Useful when you want to emphasize an action **without using a solid background**, such as in dense layouts or alongside filled buttons.

## Sizes

- **sm** - compact button for dense or constrained UIs.
- **md** - default size for standard actions.
- **lg** - large, attention-drawing actions such as primary CTA.
- **icon-sm / icon-md / icon-lg** - icon-only buttons with fixed width and height.

## Shapes

- **rectangle** - default, versatile shape for most use cases.
- **pill** - friendlier, softer shape suitable for marketing or CTA emphasis.
- **circle** - dedicated for icon-only actions.

## UI States

The Button component supports the following UI states:

- **Default** - initial visual appearance.
- **Hover** - pointer hovering state.
- **Active / Pressed** - when the button is pressed.
- **Disabled** - inactive, non-interactive state.
- **Loading** - shows a spinner and blocks interaction.
- **Focus** - visible outline when accessed via keyboard.

## Interaction & Behavior

- The Button triggers the `onClick` handler when activated.
- Storybook logs click events in the **Actions** panel.
- For forms, pass `type="submit"` when the Button should submit data.
- Setting `isLoading` automatically disables the Button and shows a spinner.
- When `variant="outline-primary"`, text and icons use the secondary content color by default.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={ButtonStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **only one** primary button per screen to maintain a clear visual hierarchy.
- Use **outline primary** when you need a primary action with less visual dominance.
- Use secondary buttons for alternative or supporting actions.
- Use tertiary buttons for inline or low-emphasis actions.
- Avoid using circle buttons without icons.
- Prefer `isLoading` over manually combining `disabled` and loading states.

---

## Accessibility

- Uses a semantic `<button>` element for accessibility.
- Focus styles are preserved for keyboard navigation.
- Ensure button labels or icons have clear meaning.
- Icon-only buttons should always have an accessible label (e.g. `aria-label`).
