# Link

`Link` is used for text-based navigation, both for internal routing (Next.js) and external URLs.  
This component supports visual variants, sizes, and right-side icons to indicate specific link behavior (e.g., external link indicator).

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `variant`, `size`, `withIcon`, and custom `rightIcon`.

---

## Variants

### Underline

Use this variant when you want the link to be visually obvious, especially inside body text.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Underline} />

### No underline

A subtle option, ideal when the surrounding UI already communicates interactivity (e.g., link lists, navigation items).

<Canvas of={LinkStories.NoUnderline} />

---

## Sizes

Link supports three sizes that adjust both text and icon scale:

- **sm** - compact link for dense UI or small captions.
- **md** - the default size, suitable for general content.
- **lg** - large link size for visually emphasized CTAs or key actions.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Sizes} />

---

## Icons

`Link` can display an icon on the right:

- The default icon visually indicates an external link.
- Use `rightIcon` to replace the icon with any custom element.
- Use `withIcon={false}` to hide the icon entirely.

### Custom Icon Example

<Canvas of={LinkStories.WithCustomIcon} />

### Without Icon

<Canvas of={LinkStories.WithoutIcon} />

---

## External Links

When linking externally, you should set:

- `target="_blank"`
- `rel="noreferrer"` or `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

This improves security and prevents window object access.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.External} />

---

## Inline Usage

`Link` is safe and visually balanced when embedded directly in paragraphs, replacing a standard `<a>` element while maintaining design consistency.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.InlineTextUsage} />

---

## Interaction & Behavior

- Built on top of `next/link`, enabling seamless Next.js routing.
- Supports standard anchor tag attributes (`href`, `target`, `rel`, `aria-*`, etc.).
- `onClick` events are logged through Storybook's **Actions** panel.
- Icon behavior is fully customizable through `withIcon` and `rightIcon`.

---

## Props

<ArgTypes of={LinkStories} />

---

## Usage Guidelines

- **Use underline** for inline text links to maximize clarity.
- **Use no-underline** for navigational contexts where interactivity is already obvious.
- Icons are helpful when:
  - indicating external navigation,
  - showing special status (e.g., "new"),
  - differentiating link behavior (e.g., opens modal or file).
- Avoid overusing icons—too many icons reduce scannability.
- Ensure the meaning of the link remains clear even without surrounding context.

---

## Accessibility

- Link text should be descriptive; avoid vague labels like “click here.”
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- Consider informing users when a link opens a new tab (via text or tooltip).
- The component preserves native anchor semantics for screen reader support.
