# Onboarding Tooltip

The **Onboarding Tooltip** component is used to guide users through product features or UI elements.
Unlike a standard tooltip, it uses a **screen mask (overlay)** to focus attention and reduce interaction with the rest of the interface.

---

## Playground

Try changing **Size**, **Placement**, or click the **Overlay** to close.
This Canvas has extra space so the tooltip doesn't get clipped or repositioned automatically.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

<Controls of={Stories.Default} />

---

## Examples

### Small

<Canvas of={Stories.Small} />

---

### Large

<Canvas of={Stories.Large} />

---

### Bottom Placement

<Canvas of={Stories.BottomPlacement} />

---

### Interactive (Controlled)

This example demonstrates a **controlled** onboarding tooltip using the `open` prop.
The open state is managed externally and can be toggled via buttons.

<Canvas of={Stories.ManualImplementation} />

---

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />

## Styling

### Container

- `p-[12px] bg-white text-black rounded-[16px]`

### Title

- `font-semibold text-[16px]`

### Description

- `text-[14px] font-normal`

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- Introducing a new feature or UI flow.
- Highlighting an important control the user must understand.
- Step-based onboarding where attention must stay on one element.

### When Not to Use

- For small hints or non-essential info (use a standard **Tooltip**).
- For complex content or multi-step forms (use a **Dialog**).

### Content Recommendations

- Keep titles short and action-oriented.
- Keep descriptions concise and scannable.
- Focus each tooltip on a single concept.

### Behavior

- The overlay should dim the rest of the UI to focus attention.
- Always provide a clear primary action (e.g., **Got it!**, **Next**).
- Recommended close options:
  - Click overlay (optional, configurable)
  - Press `Esc` (recommended)

---

## Accessibility

- Uses `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"` to indicate a modal-like surface.
- Ensure the CTA in the footer is keyboard accessible.
- If you need strict focus containment (focus trap), integrate a focus-trap utility.

---

## Notes

- Positioning is intentionally lightweight (no external positioning library).
- For advanced collision handling (auto shift/flip, viewport edge cases), consider integrating Floating UI.
