# Empty State

Appears when there is no data to display and describes what the user can do next.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `title`, `description`, `layout`, and action handlers like `onPrimaryClick`, `onSecondaryClick`, and `onClose`.

---

## Layouts

The `layout` prop controls the overall structure of the Empty State. It supports three values:

- **default** – stacked layout with illustration on top and content below.
- **horizontal** – side-by-side layout for wider viewports.
- **card** – contained card with optional close button and actions.

### Default Layout

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.PhoneDefault} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.TabletDefault} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.DesktopDefault} />

### Horizontal Layout

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.PhoneHorizontal} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.TabletHorizontal} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.DesktopHorizontal} />

### Card Layout

<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.PhoneCard} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.TabletCard} />
<Canvas of={EmptyStateStories.DesktopCard} />

---

## Content

The Empty State supports configurable content:

- `title` – concise, action-oriented title.
- `description` – supporting text explaining context and next steps.

---

## Actions

In `card` layout, the component renders primary and secondary actions:

- `primaryButtonLabel`
- `secondaryButtonLabel`
- `onPrimaryClick`
- `onSecondaryClick`
- `onClose` (close icon)

## Usage Guidelines

- Explain **why** no content appears and guide users toward their next action.
- Use only **one** primary action.
- Prefer `horizontal` only on wider layouts.
- Use `card` when the empty state is part of a sectional container.

---

## Accessibility

- Ensure meaningful action labels.
- Illustration alt text should be descriptive or decorative depending on use.
- Close button must include an accessible label and be keyboard-focusable.
