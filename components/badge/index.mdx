# Badge

Offers quick context about the item category, status, or meaning.  
Badges can represent metadata such as status, category, counts, or small indicators.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props like `variant`, `size`, and icon options.

---

## Variants

Badges support multiple emphasis and semantic variants:

- **Primary** — main highlight; used sparingly for emphasis.
- **Secondary** — neutral badges for categories or descriptors.
- **Destructive** — indicates critical or error states.
- **Semantic colors** (`blue`, `green`, `red`, `brown`) — used for info, success, error, and warning contexts.

---

## Sizes

- **lg** — primary label-style badge (text + optional icon).
- **md** — compact pill, often used for tags or counts.
- **dot** — minimal status indicator placed beside another element.

## Icons

Badges can optionally include icons to reinforce meaning.

Common uses:

- Status or semantic badges with icons.
- Numeric count badges with contextual icons.

## Interaction

- Badges are typically informational but can be made interactive via `onClick`.
- For proper accessibility, wrap interactive badges with a button or anchor element.
- In Storybook, click events appear in the **Actions** panel.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **primary** badges sparingly to avoid visual noise.
- Use **secondary** badges for neutral tags or descriptors.
- Use red/destructive variants only for negative or critical states.
- Avoid long text; keep labels short and scannable.
- Use **dot** size only alongside another element, not standalone.

---

## Accessibility

- Ensure interactive badges use appropriate semantic elements (`<button>`, `<a>`) with ARIA support.
- Provide meaningful text so screen readers can understand the badge.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast between background and text.
