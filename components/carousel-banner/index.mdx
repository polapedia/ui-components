# Carousel Banner

Carousel Banner is a full-width image-based slider component used to display promotional or hero banners.

This component is designed to work with **pre-designed banner images** (e.g. `banner.png`) where all visual content (text, CTA, decoration) is already embedded in the image.

---

## Features

- Full-width responsive banner images
- Smooth slide transitions
- Navigation arrows (previous / next)
- Pagination using **CarouselIndicator**
- Optional autoplay support
- Two layout variants:
  - **inside** - footer content positioned inside the banner
  - **outside** - footer content rendered below the banner

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

---

## Variants

### Inside Variant

Footer content (link + indicator) is positioned **inside** the banner using absolute positioning.

Recommended for:

- Marketing hero sections
- Promotional campaigns
- High-visibility banners

<Canvas of={Stories.VariantInside} />

---

### Outside Variant

Footer content is rendered **outside** the banner container.

Recommended for:

- Content-driven layouts
- Pages where banner visuals should remain untouched

<Canvas of={Stories.VariantOutside} />

---

## Autoplay

Carousel Banner supports autoplay for automatic slide transitions.

Autoplay can be enabled using:

- `autoPlay: true`
- `interval` (milliseconds between slide changes)

<Canvas of={Stories.Autoplay} />

### Autoplay Rules

- Autoplay runs only when:
  - `autoPlay` is enabled
  - `slides.length > 1`
- Autoplay is automatically stopped when the component unmounts

---

## Behavior

- Slides can be navigated via:
  - Arrow buttons (previous / next)
  - Clicking pagination indicators
- Pagination indicators allow direct navigation to a specific slide
- Arrow buttons appear on hover
- Slide animation uses CSS transform for smooth performance

## Usage Example

```tsx
import CarouselBanner from '@/components/carousel-banner';

const slides = [
  {
    id: 1,
    imageSrc: '/images/banner.png',
    linkUrl: '/promo',
    altText: '50% Discount Promotion',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    imageSrc: '/images/banner-2.png',
    linkUrl: '/campaign',
    altText: 'Independence Day Campaign',
  },
];

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <CarouselBanner slides={slides} variant="inside" autoPlay interval={5000} />
  );
}
```

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **high-resolution images** with consistent aspect ratios.
- Embed all textual content and CTAs directly inside the banner image.
- Keep the number of slides reasonable (recommended: 3-5).
- Use the `inside` variant for promotional or marketing-heavy pages.
- Use the `outside` variant for cleaner, content-first layouts.

---

## Best Practices

- Always provide descriptive `altText` for banner images.
- Avoid mixing banners with significantly different heights.
- Disable autoplay for critical or information-dense content.
- Prefer `object-cover` to ensure the banner fills the container.
- Keep autoplay intervals long enough for comfortable viewing (≥ 3s).

---

## Accessibility

- Navigation arrows include descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
- Banner images support `altText` for screen readers.
- Pagination indicators are keyboard-accessible via `CarouselIndicator`.
- Focus styles are preserved for all interactive elements.

---

## Notes

- Carousel Banner does **not** render text or buttons on top of images.
- All visual content should be part of the banner image itself.
- This component is optimized for promotional and marketing use cases.
