# Loader Skeleton

The Skeleton component is used to display a placeholder preview of content before the data gets loaded.
It helps reduce perceived waiting time and provides a better user experience by maintaining the layout structure during data fetching.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SkeletonStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

You can adjust the `className` in the **Controls** panel to change dimensions (e.g., `w-full`, `h-8`).

---

## Shapes

The Skeleton is flexible and adapts to the shape of the content it mimics. By default, it applies `rounded-md`.
However, if you provide a specific border-radius class (like `rounded-full`), the component detects it and overrides the default.

### Default (Rounded-MD)

Used for text lines, rectangular images, or general blocks.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStories.Default} />

### Circle

Used for avatars, circular icons, or buttons. Achieved by adding `rounded-full` to the className.

<Canvas of={SkeletonStories.Circle} />

---

## Complex Composition

Skeletons are most effective when combined to mimic the actual layout of a component (like a card, profile header, or list item).

<Canvas of={SkeletonStories.CardExample} />

---

## Props

The Skeleton component accepts all standard `HTMLDivElement` props. The most common prop used is `className` for sizing.

<ArgTypes of={SkeletonStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

- **Sizing:** The Skeleton does not have intrinsic size. You **must** provide width and height classes (e.g., `w-12 h-12` or `w-full h-4`) via `className`.
- **Rounding Logic:** The component automatically applies `rounded-md`. If you need a different radius (e.g., `rounded-xl`, `rounded-full`, or `rounded-none`), simply add that class to `className`, and the default will be removed.
- **Color:** The pulse animation uses `bg-loader-base`. Ensure this variable is defined in your Tailwind config or CSS variables.

---

## Accessibility

- **ARIA:** Skeletons are visual indicators. It is often good practice to mark them as `aria-hidden="true"` so screen readers ignore them, or ensure the parent container has `aria-busy="true"` until the real content loads.
- **Contrast:** The skeleton color should be subtle enough not to distract but visible enough to indicate structure.
