# LoaderCustom

LoaderCustom is a dedicated component for displaying animated loading states using Lottie animations.
It is primarily used to provide visual feedback during asynchronous actions, data fetching, or processing steps.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

Since this component currently does not accept props, it relies on its parent container for sizing.
It uses `w-full` internally, meaning it will expand to fill the width of the element wrapping it.

---

## Sizing Behavior

The `LoaderCustom` adapts to the width of its parent. Below are examples of how the loader scales when placed inside containers of different widths.

## Usage Example

An example of the loader used within a card component context to indicate a processing state.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Container Sizing:** Always wrap `<LoaderCustom />` in a `div` with a specific width (e.g., `w-12`, `w-24`) to control its size, otherwise it might take up the full screen width depending on the layout.
- **Context:** Use this for block-level loading (e.g., loading a section of a page). For button loading states, use the `isLoading` prop on the Button component instead.
- **Consistency:** Ensure the wrapper size is consistent across similar pages to prevent layout shifts.
