# Chip

Chips represent compact UI elements used for labels, categories, or lightweight actions.  
Depending on the variant, they may contain text, icons, or an avatar element.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore properties such as `variant`, `size`, left/right icons, and behavioral states like `disabled`.

## Variants

### Default

The standard chip with a text label and optional icons.

### Avatar

A chip that includes an avatar-like element on the left side — ideal for representing users, assignees, or identifiable entities.

### Icon Left

A chip with a leading icon, useful for indicating type or category.

### Icon Right

A chip with a trailing icon, often used for dropdown indicators (chevron) or dismiss actions (close icon).

## Sizes

Chips come in three sizes:

- **xs** – compact chips suitable for secondary or dense UI layouts.
- **sm** – the default size for most use cases.
- **md** – a larger size for increased readability or larger touch targets.

## UI States

The Chip component supports the following states:

- **Default** – neutral appearance.
- **Hover** – slightly elevated surface and stronger border.
- **Active / Pressed** – gradient background with white text.
- **Disabled** – muted colors and non-interactive.
- **Focus** – visible ring using `focus-visible` for keyboard users.

## Icon Usage

Chips support icons on both sides:

- Use `leftIcon` for icons on the left (e.g., type indicators).
- Use `rightIcon` for icons on the right (e.g., dropdown chevron or close icon).
- Icon sizes automatically adjust based on the chip’s `size` (`xs`, `sm`, `md`) — no manual sizing required.

Examples:

- `WithLeftIcon` – chip with a leading icon.
- `WithRightIcon` – chip with a trailing icon.
- `WithCloseIcon` – chip that visually behaves like a “closable” chip (uses `rightIcon` with a close icon).

## Interaction & Behavior

- The Chip uses a semantic `<button>` element.
- Click interactions are captured in the **Actions** panel via `onClick: "clicked"`.
- Chips are **not toggle components** by default:
  - If toggle behavior is needed, manage the state externally and update styling accordingly.
- The `disabled` prop prevents interaction and dims the appearance.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use chips for:
  - Filter selections
  - Category labels
  - Compact, inline actions
  - Representing entities (avatar variant)
- Avoid using chips as replacements for primary CTAs — use **Button** instead.
- Keep labels short; chips are designed for brief, scannable content.
- Use right icons strategically:
  - Chevron → opens a dropdown or menu
  - Close icon → indicates dismissal/removal
- Do not overload chips with too many elements; keep them simple.

---

## Accessibility

- Chips use semantic `<button>`, ensuring:
  - Keyboard access via <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and <kbd>Space</kbd>
  - Recognition as a button by screen readers
- Focus states are visible with `focus-visible` to support accessible navigation.
- Provide an `aria-label` when using icon-only chips to clarify their purpose.
- Ensure chip labels are descriptive enough for assistive technology.
