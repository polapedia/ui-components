# Carousel Indicator

Carousel Indicator is a compact pagination control for carousels/sliders.
It displays a row of dots where the active item becomes an “open” pill shape.

- **Inactive:** circular dot
- **Active:** pill (“open”) indicator
- **Sizes:** `sm`, `md`, `lg`

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Provide `onActiveChange` to enable interactivity (click to jump to a slide).

---

## Sizes

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

---

## Interactive Example

<Canvas of={Stories.Interactive} />

---

## Behavior

- When `onActiveChange` is provided (and not disabled), indicators render as `<button>` elements.
- Without `onActiveChange`, indicators render as non-interactive `<span>` elements.
- Active indicator is determined by `activeIndex`.

---

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep `total` aligned with the number of slides/items.
- Use a controlled state for `activeIndex` for predictable behavior.
- Use `sm` for dense UI, `md` as default, and `lg` for more emphasis.

---

## Accessibility

- Interactive mode uses `role="tablist"` and `role="tab"`.
- Each indicator includes `aria-label="Go to slide X"` and `aria-selected`.
- Focus styles are visible via `focus-visible` ring.
