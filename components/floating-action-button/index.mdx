# Floating Action Button (FAB)

A Floating Action Button (FAB) performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.  
It appears in front of all screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its center.

---

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Primary />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

Use the **Controls** panel to explore props such as `variant`, `size`, and `icon`.

---

## Variants

### Primary

The standard action button (Dark Red), used for the most common action on the screen (e.g., "Create", "Add").

<Canvas of={FABStories.Primary} />

### Danger

Bright red version, used for destructive or high-priority alert actions.

<Canvas of={FABStories.Danger} />

---

## Sizes

- **sm** - compact size for dense interfaces or secondary FABs.
- **md** - medium size.
- **lg** - large (default), standard size for the main screen action.

<Canvas>
  <div className="flex items-end gap-6 p-4">
    <FABStories.Primary args={{ size: "sm" }} />
    <FABStories.Primary args={{ size: "md" }} />
    <FABStories.Primary args={{ size: "lg" }} />
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Placement (Sticky Bottom-Right)

FAB are typically placed **sticky / fixed** in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

The following example shows a FAB positioned fixed in the `bottom-right` viewport:

<Canvas of={FABStories.StickyBottomRight} />

**Implementation notes:**

- Use utility classes like `fixed bottom-6 right-6` to stick to the bottom-right corner.
- Set the `layout` in Storybook to `"fullscreen"` so the page can simulate the appearance of a real app.
- Be sure to add a descriptive `aria-label` to the FAB.

---

## UI States

The FAB component supports the following UI states (handled via CSS):

- **Default** - initial visual appearance.
- **Hover** - darker shade to indicate interactivity.
- **Active / Pressed** - darkest shade to indicate activation.
- **Focus** - visible ring outline when accessed via keyboard.

---

## Interaction & Behavior

- The FAB triggers the `onClick` handler when activated.
- It is typically fixed at the bottom-right of the screen.
- It comes with a built-in shadow to indicate elevation above other content.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={FABStories} />

## Usage Guidelines

- **Placement:** Usually positioned at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
- **Frequency:** Use **only one** FAB per screen to maintain a clear primary action.
- **Iconography:** Use a clear, simple icon (like `+` for add or a pencil for edit).
- **Accessibility:** Since FABs usually contain only icons, ensure the button has a descriptive `aria-label` or the icon is accessible.
